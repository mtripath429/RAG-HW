When you’re building a RAG system across mixed document types like .pdf, .docx, and .txt, the current ecosystem of document loaders is helpful but still pretty rough around the edges. The loaders do a solid job with the basics: they normalize different formats into a common structure, attach minimal metadata, and plug cleanly into downstream steps like chunking, embedding, and retrieval. This is enough to get a prototype up quickly, especially when you just need to ingest a folder of files and generate a vector index around it. For simple text or clean PDFs, they work exactly as advertised.

The cracks show up the moment your documents are even slightly complex. PDFs with tables, charts, multi-column layouts, or embedded images almost always extract poorly — text gets mis-ordered, formatting collapses, and entire sections can go missing. Word documents aren’t much better: headings and structure are flattened, footnotes get dropped, and lists lose their hierarchy. Loaders also treat everything as unstructured text, which means they have no sense of domain semantics. If you’re dealing with memos, diligence docs, legal agreements, decks, or reports — the types of files you actually care about in a VC or operator workflow — you end up losing a lot of the structure that makes the document meaningful. And unless you override defaults, chunking happens based on character count rather than actual content boundaries, which leads to choppy retrieval and hallucination-prone answers.

The bigger issue is that most loaders are built for convenience, not accuracy or reliability. They don’t handle OCR well, they don’t preserve document hierarchy, and their metadata is too shallow to support high-quality retrieval at scale. That means you need to layer on your own preprocessing pipeline: convert PDFs intelligently, extract headings or semantic boundaries, enforce your own metadata schema, and test extraction quality before you ever embed anything. In other words, loaders are a good starting point, but you can’t depend on them to build a real GPT-style system over your documents. If you want something that actually works for internal knowledge, investment memos, or workflow automation, you need to build guardrails and structure on top — otherwise you end up with a vector store full of noise.
