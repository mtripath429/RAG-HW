When I tried building a RAG system on top of the Booth Games Group shared Google Drive, the document loaders felt helpful at first, especially with simple files. They pulled in the PDFs, Word docs, and text notes without much effort, and for a moment it seemed like I could actually build a small “Games Group assistant” that could answer basic questions about events, logistics, or our past planning docs.

But once I got deeper, the cracks became obvious. A lot of the tax exemption PDFs and calendar decks didn’t extract cleanly — text would show up out of order or entire sections would get lost. Some Word files came through, but the structure never survived the import, and anything exported from PowerPoint became an unpredictable mess. The biggest surprise was Excel files: they constantly broke the pipeline, to the point where I just removed them entirely. It became clear pretty quickly that loaders are fine for clean, simple documents but struggle with the kind of administrative mix we actually store.

What stood out to me most is that the loaders don’t really understand the intent behind the documents. They don’t know what’s an event plan, what’s a finance form, or what’s a calendar outline — everything gets flattened into plain text. So even though the RAG “worked,” it didn’t always feel reliable or aligned with how we actually use the drive. In the end, I realized that document loaders get you part of the way, but the accuracy and usefulness depend a lot on how much structure the files had to begin with.
